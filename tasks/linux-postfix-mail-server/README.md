## Linux Postfix Mail Server

### Problem

xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:

Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.

Create an email account mark@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by 8FmzjvFU6S.

Set its mail directory to /home/mark/Maildir.

Install and configure dovecot on the same server.
