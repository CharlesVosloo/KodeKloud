# KodeKloud Engineer

Hello my name is Charles Vosloo ðŸ‘‹

- This repository contains scripts that helped me with KodeKloud Engineer question, KodeKloud course (like ultimate CKAD) and can be run on KodeKloud playgrounds.
- These are in the form of ansible playbooks. It is actually quite easy to install ansible on a remote server.
- The following TUI tools have helped me:
- For kubernetes questions, it is very useful to have k9s installed, particularly if you are doing a long question or doing any troubelshooting. And the why not just install some kubectl pluging that you are used to like ctx,ns or neat.   
- For git questions, I like lazygit, it cuts down on the need to memorizing commands.
- For writing ansible palybooks, the default vi editor doesn't cut it, so I insall vim and vim-essentials. Ansible syntax highlighting/suggestions is trciky: this requres a lengthy .virmrc complete with plugin manager. I like the helix editor, but I haven't found a quick way to instlal it on centos.          
- What's really cool, with having ansible installed, I am able to do many KodeKloud Engineer linux questions, using Anisble the way it was intended to be used.

# Getting Started

## On Jump host

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CharlesVosloo/kodekloud-engineer.git`
- Go to folder: `cd kodekloud-engineer`
- Run this scipt as roor: `./install_ansible.sh`
- This scipt installs epel-release and ansible and then sets up ansible by copying the KodeKlode servers inventory file to ansible's default lcation /etc/ansible/anisble.cfg and configires /etc/anisible/hosts. 
- Ansible ad hoc cammands can be run from any location

## An example of how to solve linux problems with ansible

## Playbook 1: configure jump host for ansible devlepment questions
## Playbook 2: for git questions
## Playbook 3: for kubernetes questions
## Playbook 4  for ultimat CKAD
